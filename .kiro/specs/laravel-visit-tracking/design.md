# Design Document

## Overview

The Laravel Visit Tracking feature integrates the Spatie Laravel Visit package to provide comprehensive analytics for both frontend and admin panel interactions. The system will automatically track page visits, associate them with users and models, and provide a rich analytics dashboard within the Filament admin panel.

## Architecture

### Package Integration
- **Spatie Laravel Visit**: Core package for visit tracking functionality
- **Database Layer**: Visit records stored in dedicated tables with relationships
- **Middleware Integration**: Automatic tracking through Laravel middleware
- **Filament Integration**: Custom admin pages and widgets for analytics display

### Data Flow
1. User visits a page (frontend or admin)
2. Middleware captures visit information
3. Visit record created with associated data (user, model, referrer)
4. Analytics dashboard queries and displays aggregated data
5. Administrators view insights and export data

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Visit Tracking Middleware
- **Purpose**: Automatically capture visits on all routes
- **Scope**: Both frontend and admin panel routes
- **Functionality**:
  - Extract visit metadata (IP, user agent, referrer)
  - Associate with authenticated user if available
  - Create visit records in database
  - Handle model associations for content pages

### 2. Visit Analytics Dashboard
- **Location**: Filament admin panel
- **Components**:
  - Overview widgets showing key metrics
  - Detailed analytics page with filters and charts
  - Model-specific visit statistics
  - Export functionality for data analysis

### 3. Model Visit Tracking
- **Implementation**: Trait for trackable models
- **Functionality**:
  - Automatic visit counting for model instances
  - Visit history per model
  - Popular content identification

### 4. Configuration Management
- **Settings Page**: Filament-based configuration interface
- **Options**:
  - Enable/disable tracking by route type
  - Data retention settings
  - IP exclusion rules
  - Export preferences

## Data Models

### Visit Record Structure
```php
// Provided by Spatie Laravel Visit
- id: Primary key
- visitable_type: Model class name (nullable)
- visitable_id: Model instance ID (nullable)
- visitor_type: User model class (nullable)
- visitor_id: User ID (nullable)
- ip: Visitor IP address
- user_agent: Browser user agent
- referer: Referrer URL
- url: Visited URL
- method: HTTP method
- created_at: Visit timestamp
```

### Analytics Aggregation
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly visit summaries
- Page popularity rankings
- Referrer source analysis
- User engagement metrics

## Error Handling

### Visit Tracking Failures
- **Strategy**: Graceful degradation - never break page functionality
- **Implementation**: Try-catch blocks around tracking code
- **Logging**: Record tracking failures for debugging
- **Fallback**: Continue page rendering if tracking fails

### Database Connection Issues
- **Strategy**: Queue-based tracking for reliability
- **Implementation**: Dispatch tracking jobs to queue
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed tracking attempts
- **Monitoring**: Alert administrators of persistent failures

### Performance Considerations
- **Async Processing**: Use queued jobs for heavy analytics calculations
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize queries with proper indexes
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed analytics data
- **Batch Processing**: Group visit records for efficient database operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Visit recording functionality
- Model association logic
- Analytics calculation methods
- Configuration validation

### Integration Tests
- Middleware integration with routes
- Database record creation
- Filament dashboard functionality
