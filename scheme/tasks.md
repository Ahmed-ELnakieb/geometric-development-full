- `video_preview_url` (string, 500, nullable) - Background preview video path
- Both fields can be managed from CMS dashboard

### 2025-10-19 - Verification Comments Implementation
- **Comment 1 - Video Preview URL**: ✅ Already implemented
  - Migration exists and ran successfully
  - Seeder already includes test data for all projects
  - Column is properly nullable and 500 chars
  
- **Comment 2 - Categories Column Fix**: ✅ Fixed
  - Replaced `separator()` and `limit()` with `limitList(3)` in `ProjectResource.php`

- **Comment 3 - Legacy Media FK Cleanup**: ✅ Completed
  - Removed unused relation methods from `Project.php`: `featuredImage()`, `videoFile()`, `brochure()`, `factsheet()`
  - Admin form exclusively uses Spatie Media Library collections
  - Frontend views already use Spatie collections (`getFirstMedia()`)
  - Fixed `show.blade.php` to remove `$project->videoFile` reference
  - Created and ran migration to drop legacy FK columns and constraints:
    - `featured_image_id`
    - `video_file_id`
    - `brochure_id`
    - `factsheet_id`
  - All consumers now use Spatie collections exclusively
  
- **AdminPanelProvider Fix**: Fixed missing plugin references
  - Commented out uninstalled plugins: `SpatieLaravelMediaLibraryPlugin` and `FilamentMediaManagerPlugin`
  - Added notes indicating packages are not installed

### 2025-10-20 - Blog Post Verification Fixes

  - Replaced `limit(2)` and `limit(3)` with proper `state()` callback using `take()`
  - Now properly limits number of badge items instead of truncating characters
  - Categories limited to 2 items, tags limited to 3 items
  
- **Comment 3 - Migration Safety**: Fixed `2025_10_19_create_drop_legacy_featured_image_fk_from_blog_posts_table.php`
  - Added `Schema::hasColumn()` check before dropping
  - Wrapped foreign key drop in try/catch for safety
  - Migration now idempotent and safe to run multiple times

  - Removed `featured_image_id` from `$fillable` array
  - Deleted `featuredImage()` relation method
  - Updated all controllers to remove eager loading of `featuredImage`
  - Updated all views to use `getFirstMediaUrl('featured_image')` instead of `featuredImage` relation
  - Files updated: `BlogController.php`, `HomeController.php`, `index.blade.php`, `show.blade.php`, `home.blade.php`
  
- **Comment 5 - Backfill Command Disk Support**: Fixed `BackfillBlogPostMediaCollections.php`

  - Added `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage;` import
  - Now supports non-local disks (S3, etc.) without errors
  
- **Comment 6 - Published Date Dehydration**: Fixed `BlogPostResource.php`
  - Added `->dehydrated(fn (Get $get) => $get('is_published'))` to `published_at` field
  - Prevents saving date when post is not published

- **Comment 2 - CV File ID Nullable**: Created migration and updated forms
  - Created `2025_10_20_000001_make_cv_file_id_nullable_in_career_applications_table.php`
  - Made `career_applications.cv_file_id` nullable
  - Changed FK from `cascadeOnDelete()` to `nullOnDelete()`
  - Added `afterSave()` hook in `EditCareerApplication.php` to sync cv_file_id with Spatie Media
  - Added `after()` callback in `ApplicationsRelationManager.php` EditAction to sync cv_file_id
  - Migration applied successfully - CV upload is now optional in admin forms
  
- **Comment 3 - Frontend CV Validation**: Aligned with database schema
  - Frontend controller already correctly handles optional cv_file
  - Creates application first, then updates cv_file_id only when file exists
  - Will work correctly after migration is applied
  
- **Comment 4 - Expired Filter Date Logic**: Fixed `CareerResource.php`
  - Changed `expired` filter from `where('expires_at', '<', now())` to `whereDate('expires_at', '<', today())`
  - Changed `not_expired` filter from `orWhere('expires_at', '>=', now())` to `orWhereDate('expires_at', '>=', today())`
  - Now uses date-only comparison, treating listings expiring today as still active
  
- **Comment 5 - Unified Status Badge**: Added to `CareerResource.php`
  - Added `status` column using `getStateUsing()` to compute Active/Expired/Inactive
  - Badge colors: Active => success, Expired => danger, Inactive => gray
  - Made `is_active` column toggleable and hidden by default
  - Status badge appears before `is_featured` column

- **Status**: ✅ All 5 verification comments implemented successfully

- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - migrations now run successfully

### 2025-10-20 - dateTimeFormat Method Error Fix
- **Issue**: `BadMethodCallException: Method dateTimeFormat does not exist` on blog-posts and career applications
- **Cause**: Incorrect Filament API usage - `->dateTime()->dateTimeFormat('format')` 
- **Fix**: Pass format directly to dateTime() method: `->dateTime('format')`
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `BlogPostResource.php`: Changed `->dateTime()->dateTimeFormat('M d, Y')` to `->dateTime('M d, Y')`
  - `ApplicationsRelationManager.php`: Changed `->dateTime()->dateTimeFormat('M d, Y H:i')` to `->dateTime('M d, Y H:i')`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - admin panels now load successfully

### 2025-10-20 - SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload Closure Error Fix
- **Issue**: `TypeError: closure(): Argument #2 ($file) must be of type string, null given` when editing resources with media fields
- **Root Cause**: Internal `getUploadedFileUsing` closure in SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload expects file UUID string but receives null for empty media collections
- **Fixes Applied to ALL Filament Resources**:
  1. **ProjectResource.php**:
     - Removed `->image()` from: hero_slider, hero_thumbnails, gallery, about_image
     - Removed `->acceptedFileTypes()` from: brochure, factsheet, documents
     - Added `->visibility('public')` + `->maxSize(10240)` to ALL media fields
  2. **BlogPostResource.php**:
     - Removed `->image()` from: featured_image, content_images
     - Added `->visibility('public')` to both fields
  3. **CareerResource.php**:
     - Removed `->image()` from: department_image
     - Removed `->acceptedFileTypes()` from: job_description
     - Added `->visibility('public')` + `->maxSize(10240)` to both fields
  4. **CareerApplicationResource.php**:
     - Removed `->acceptedFileTypes()` from: cv_files
     - Added `->visibility('public')` + `->maxSize(10240)`
  5. **ApplicationsRelationManager.php**:
     - Removed `->acceptedFileTypes()` from: cv_files
     - Added `->visibility('public')` + `->maxSize(10240)`
  6. **Database Cleanup**: Cleared corrupted media collection data for all 6 projects using cleanup script
     - Removed malformed Livewire serialized data: `[{"":null},{"s":"arr"}]`
     - Collections cleared: hero_slider, hero_thumbnails, gallery, about_image, brochure, factsheet, documents
- **Reason**: 
  - File type validation already handled by Model's `registerMediaCollections()` via `acceptsMimeTypes()`
  - `->image()` internally uses `acceptedFileTypes()` which has the same closure issue
  - `->visibility('public')` ensures proper initialization and prevents private file processing errors
  - Database had corrupted/malformed serialized media data from seeding
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - all admin edit pages now load without errors

### 2025-10-20 - Video Preview Upload with Media Library

  2. **ProjectResource** (`ProjectResource.php`):
     - Replaced TextInput with `SpatieMediaLibraryFileUpload`
     - Collection: `video_preview`
     - Max size: 51200 KB (50MB)
     - Visibility: public
     - Label: "Video Preview File"
  3. **Frontend View** (`show.blade.php`):
     - Updated video source to prioritize media library: `$project->getFirstMediaUrl('video_preview')`
     - Fallback chain: Media Library → `video_preview_url` → default asset
     - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `video_preview_url` field
- **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Upload videos directly through admin panel
  - ✅ Browse and select from media library
  - ✅ Automatic file management and storage
  - ✅ Backward compatible with existing data
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented - video preview now uses media library with proper fallbacks
